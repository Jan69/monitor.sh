shell script that monitors file modifying times and outputs when file's changed,
optionally flashes scroll lock light  
bundles with "dsleep", which is just a fractional sleep,
since gnu sleep allowing for less than a second (like sleep 0.5) isn't guaranteed to exist on the system

getopt.sh and getopts.sh do exactly the same thing, for portability, one of them should always work
syntax for them is "-c command -f file/argument" any amount of them
each -c setting the command for the next -f
each -f executing another instance of the command set by last -c
you can do "-c echo -f hello -f world"
and it will execute "echo hello" and "echo world", useful if you do repeating commands,
most useful for scripts, such as monitor.sh and cronjobs
